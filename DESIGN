Or, lack thereof: notes as I try to puzzle out the intended and ideal designs for this gem

I think:

Session is the ongoing communication with a particular client

Transport is the particular flavor of communication - it should manage the
interactions between requests, response, and session.

Part of the challenge here is that we're emulating one kind of FSM using
several others - a Transport is theoretically the component responsible for the
translation.

Specific perverse case: the EventSource transport:

Client long-GETs /eventsource - that's it's receiving pipe.
Client POSTs to /xhr_send to send data - but those requests receive empty 204

So, the *session* needs to remember what Transport is in play, and the
Transport handling a particular request needs to defer to the owning transport.
