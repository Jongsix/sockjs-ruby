consternant: @botanicus unicorn enables Rack::Chunked since v4.1.0 bit.ly/cag377

majek04: @botanicus Thin doesn't do proper 'transfer-encoding: chunked' but it can do a very similar thing (relying on 'connection: close').

judofyr: @botanicus Mongrel supports streaming body.each. Thin/Unicorn supports streaming through env['async.callback']



majek:

In SRS we were using Sinatra with Thin. To get long polling working,
we used "Thin::Connection::AsyncResponse" magic.
The views looked like that:

 get '/instances/:ver' do
   some_waiting_on_eventmachine_here do |stuff|
     finish JSON.pretty_generate stuff
   end
   Thin::Connection::AsyncResponse
 end

Where finish is:

 def finish(data, status=200, user_headers={})
   headers = {'Content-Type' => 'text/plain'}.update( user_headers )
   data = [data] if data.is_a? String
   env['async.callback'].call [status, headers, data]
 end


Quite hacky, and Thin-dependent, but hey, it works.

Of course websockets are a bigger issue. You can take a
look at the eventmachine-websockety think you've found
and see if it integrates with any http server.

This article explains everything. Also take a look:
  https://github.com/macournoyer/pusher

I've attached a dumb example of how to do streaming (multiple responses).

It doesn't do "Transfer-Encoding: chunked", (it does the http/1.0
compatible thing - "Connection: close" and no "content-length")
but it doesn't matter.

(You can easily emulate proper chunking for 1.1 clients:
 just set the header and send data with leading length. But there is
 little benefit for that, as thin will not try to reuse connections
 using "connection: keepalive", so feel free to ignore the problem for
 now)
